## Setup

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
2. Use the command line tool called `pip` to install the following Python libraries (Enter `pip install package-name` in CMD or PowerShell):
    - `opencv-python`
    - `pyvirtualcam`
3. Change parameters in the file called `camera_switch.py` according to your needs.
4. Use the `python` command to run the `camera_switch.py` program (Enter `python camera_swich.py` in CMD or PowerShell and make sure you are in the correct directory).

## Important notes

While you do need to install OBS Studio to run the Python application, I does not need to be running in order to use the virtual camera.
We used Python version 3.9.7 for our tests, using a different version might cause some issues.
Make sure you have 2 or more camera inputs when running the program.
